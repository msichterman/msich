              I inherited this device through a previous internship when it was
              deemed &quot;end-of-life&quot; for the organization. It does
              absolutely everything I need it to, so no plans to rush to an
              upgrade. Though, I was lucky enough to run a M1 MacBook Pro in a
              previous job, and those things are NICE. I will probably crack
              eventually and get Apple silicon for my next device.

              Thank you Costco. This is an excellent combo and I really have no
              complaints. I love being able to switch from my personal computer
              to my work computer with the click of a button. If you&apos;re
              looking for something modest that gets the job done, I highly
              recommend this combo.

              If I&apos;m going to work on my computer all day and all night, I
              might as well do it on an awesome desk. This was a graduation
              gift, and I love being able to sit-stand-sit-stand throughout the
              day.

              I feel clumsy in any other design tool. Figma is great for design,

              more. Hopefully Adobe does&apos;t mess this up.
